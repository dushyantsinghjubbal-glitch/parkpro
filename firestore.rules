/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements an "Open Access Model" for rapid prototyping.
 * It assumes that any user, authenticated or not, has full access to manage all data.
 * This is insecure for production but ideal for the initial development phase.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized around parking events. A top-level
 * `parking_records` collection holds all parking sessions. A separate `app_config`
 * collection holds global settings like pricing.
 * - /users/{userId}
 * - /parking_records/{parkingRecordId}
 * - /parking_records/{parkingRecordId}/receipts/{receiptId}
 * - /app_config/{configId} (e.g., /app_config/pricing)
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Access: All read and write operations are allowed for any client.
 *   This is intentionally permissive to avoid authentication hurdles during early development.
